# CoBowling

This is a VR bowling game made by UE5. Players can throw the ball in their hands to hit the opposite glass bottle to get points. This is the first vr game I have made and I am really enjoying it.

# Score
Scores are obtained by colliding Coke bottles, and the score is the number of Coke bottles hit.

Event overlap means that when the glass bottle is hit, it will get points.

Convert fractions to text, and as integer numbers.

As shown in the picture, when the bottle is knocked down, the score obtained will be displayed.
# Sound

Make a sound and only trigger once per collision to make the collision sound more natural. So there's a sound when the ball rolls and when the bottle gets hit.
